# Organizations for Dashboard

The organizations module allows users to create organizations and invitations other users can accept to join.  Users must share the invitations themselves with the recipients.

Your application server can retrieve the organizations a user is a member of via the API, to determine if eg they can access a shared resource or for any other purpose.

## Import this module

Install the module with NPM:

    $ npm install @userdashboard/organizations

Edit your `package.json` to activate the module:

    "dashboard": {
      "modules": [
        "@userdashboard/organizations"
      ]
    }
